# my-emacs
My emacs config. one file because I keep my config very light.

To use, you have to install use-package from MELPA, but after that this should handle the rest automatically.  See [here](https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/installation/) for more info.

This will create a bunch of files in ~/.emacs.d/ if you're on Linux.  If you're on another OS, you're on your own.
